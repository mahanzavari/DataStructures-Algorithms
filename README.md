## Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate the implementation and behavior of common data structures and algorithms. It is divided into two main sections:

1.  **Sorting Algorithms**: This section provides implementations of various sorting algorithms and a script to compare their performance.
2.  **Trees**: This section includes implementations of different types of balanced and un-balanced tree data structures.

Each section has its own `README.md` with detailed information about the implementation, usage, and specific algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or higher
-   Required libraries are listed within the `README.md` of each individual module (found within `/Sorts_Algorithms`, `/Trees/AVLTree` and `/Trees/RedBlackTree`).
-   Graphviz (see `Trees/RedBlackTree/README.md` and `Trees/AVLTree/README.md` for installation)

### Cloning the repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/mahanzavari/DSA]
cd [DSA]
```
### Running the programs

Each module can be run separately. Please refer to the module's `README.md` for specific execution instructions:

*   **Sorting Algorithms:** Instructions in `Sorts_Algorithms/README.md`.
*   **AVL Tree:** Instructions in `Trees/AVLTree/README.md`.
*   **B+ Tree:** Instructions within `Trees/BTrees/BPlussTree.py`
*   **Red-Black Tree:** Instructions in `Trees/RedBlackTree/README.md`.

## Modules

### 1. Sorting Algorithms (`Sorts_Algorithms/`)

This module contains implementations and time comparisons for:

*   Quicksort
*   Randomized Quicksort
*   Insertion Sort
*   Merge Sort
*   Bubble Sort
*   Selection Sort
*   Heapsort
*   Bottom-Up Quicksort

Refer to `Sorts_Algorithms/README.md` for detailed information.
To run the program:
```bash
cd Sorts_Algorithms
python Sort_comparisons.py
```

### 2. Trees (`Trees/`)

This module contains implementations of different types of tree data structures:

*   **AVL Tree (`Trees/AVLTree/`)**: A self-balancing binary search tree with a GUI for visualization. This module contains:
    *   `AVLTree.py`: The core implementation of the AVL tree.
    *   `GUI.py`: A graphical user interface for interacting with and visualizing the tree.
    *   `main.py`: Runs the GUI application.
    *   `utils.py`: Includes utility function to perform basic operations on the tree.
    Refer to `Trees/AVLTree/README.md` for detailed information on how to run the GUI.
    To run the program:
    ```bash
    cd Trees/AVLTree
    python main.py
    ```
*   **B+ Tree (`Trees/BTrees/`)**: An implementation of a B+ tree data structure used in database indexing.
     To run the program:
     ```bash
     cd Trees/BTrees
     python BPlussTree.py --order [B+Tree order]
     ```
*   **Red-Black Tree (`Trees/RedBlackTree/`)**: A self-balancing binary search tree with command interface and visualizations using Graphviz.  This module contains:
    *   `RedBlackTree.py`: Implementation of the Red-Black Tree.
     Refer to `Trees/RedBlackTree/README.md` for details and instructions.
     To run the program:
    ```bash
     cd Trees/RedBlackTree
     python RedBlackTree.py
     ```
