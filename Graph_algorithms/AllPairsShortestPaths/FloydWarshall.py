def floyd_warsall(graph):
     """
    Floyd-Warshall Algorithm to find all-pairs shortest paths in a weighted graph.

    Parameters:
        graph (list of list of int): Adjacency matrix representation of the graph.
                                     graph[i][j] represents the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j.
                                     If there is no edge, graph[i][j] should be set to infinity (sys.maxsize).

    Returns:
        dist (list of list of int): A 2D list where dist[i][j] is the shortest distance from vertex i to vertex j.
        next_vertex (list of list of int): A 2D list used to reconstruct the shortest paths.

    Running Time:
        The algorithm runs in Î˜(V^3) time, where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
