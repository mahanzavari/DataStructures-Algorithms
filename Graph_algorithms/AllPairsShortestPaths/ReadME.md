### **1. Problem Definition**
The **all-pairs shortest-paths problem** involves finding the shortest paths between every pair of vertices in a weighted, directed graph. Here’s a deeper look:

#### **Key Points**:
- **Input**: A weighted, directed graph \( G = (V, E) \) with a weight function \( w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \). The graph may contain negative-weight edges but no negative-weight cycles.
- **Output**: A matrix \( D = (d_{ij}) \), where \( d_{ij} \) represents the shortest-path weight from vertex \( i \) to vertex \( j \). If no path exists, \( d_{ij} = \infty \).
- **Applications**:
  - **Network Diameter**: The longest shortest path in a network, which is useful for determining the worst-case communication delay in a network.
  - **Distance Tables**: Computing distances between all pairs of cities or locations, as in a road atlas.
  - **Transitive Closure**: Determining reachability between all pairs of vertices in a graph.

#### **Example**:
- If the graph represents a road network, the shortest-path weight \( d_{ij} \) could represent the shortest driving distance from city \( i \) to city \( j \).

### **2. Approaches to Solve the Problem**
The chapter discusses several approaches to solve the all-pairs shortest-paths problem:

#### **a. Repeated Single-Source Algorithms**
- **Idea**: Run a single-source shortest-path algorithm (like Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford) \(|V|\) times, once for each vertex as the source.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
  - Works for graphs with **nonnegative edge weights**.
  - Running time:
    - \( O(V^3) \) with a linear array for the min-priority queue.
    - \( O(V^2 \lg V + VE) \) with a Fibonacci heap.
  - Best for sparse graphs (where \( |E| \) is much smaller than \( |V|^2 \)).
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**:
  - Works for graphs with **negative edge weights** (but no negative-weight cycles).
  - Running time: \( O(V^2E) \), which is \( O(V^4) \) for dense graphs.
  - Slower than Dijkstra's but handles negative weights.

#### **b. Limitations**:
- Repeatedly running single-source algorithms is inefficient for large graphs, especially dense ones.
- The chapter introduces more efficient algorithms (e.g., Floyd-Warshall, Johnson's) to handle the all-pairs problem directly.

### **3. Graph Representation**
The graph is represented using an **adjacency matrix**, which is a common choice for all-pairs shortest-paths algorithms.

#### **Adjacency Matrix \( W = (w_{ij}) \)**:
- \( w_{ij} \) represents the weight of the edge from vertex \( i \) to vertex \( j \).
- The matrix is defined as:
  \[
  w_{ij} =
  \begin{cases}
  0 & \text{if } i = j, \\
  \text{weight of edge } (i, j) & \text{if } i \neq j \text{ and } (i, j) \in E, \\
  \infty & \text{if } i \neq j \text{ and } (i, j) \notin E.
  \end{cases}
  \]
- **Example**:
  - If there is no edge from \( i \) to \( j \), \( w_{ij} = \infty \).
  - If \( i = j \), \( w_{ij} = 0 \) (the distance from a vertex to itself is zero).

#### **Why Use an Adjacency Matrix?**
- **Efficiency**: Matrix operations are well-suited for dynamic programming algorithms like Floyd-Warshall and matrix multiplication-based approaches.
- **Simplicity**: The matrix representation makes it easy to access and update edge weights.

### **4. Predecessor Matrix**
In addition to the shortest-path weights, the solution includes a **predecessor matrix** \( \Pi = (\pi_{ij}) \), which helps reconstruct the shortest paths.

#### **Definition**:
- \( \pi_{ij} \) is the predecessor of vertex \( j \) on the shortest path from vertex \( i \).
- If \( i = j \) or there is no path from \( i \) to \( j \), \( \pi_{ij} = \text{NIL} \).

#### **Predecessor Subgraph**:
- For each vertex \( i \), the predecessor subgraph \( G_{\pi,i} = (V_{\pi,i}, E_{\pi,i}) \) is a shortest-paths tree rooted at \( i \).
- **Vertices**: \( V_{\pi,i} = \{ j \in V : \pi_{ij} \neq \text{NIL} \} \cup \{ i \} \).
- **Edges**: \( E_{\pi,i} = \{ (\pi_{ij}, j) : j \in V_{\pi,i} - \{ i \} \} \).

#### **Reconstructing Shortest Paths**:
- The `PRINT-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATH` procedure uses the predecessor matrix to print the shortest path from \( i \) to \( j \):
  ```python
  PRINT-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATH(Π, i, j):
      if i == j:
          print i
      elif π_ij == NIL:
          print "no path from" i "to" j "exists"
      else:
          PRINT-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATH(Π, i, π_ij)
          print j
  ```

#### **Example**:
- If \( \pi_{ij} = k \), then the shortest path from \( i \) to \( j \) goes through \( k \). The procedure recursively prints the path from \( i \) to \( k \) and then prints \( j \).
