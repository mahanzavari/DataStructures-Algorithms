Given a rod of length n

# 1. top-down with memoization In this approach
# 2. bottom-up method
# you write the procedure recursively in a natural manner, but modified to
# save the result of each subproblem (usually in an array or hash table).
# These two approaches yield algorithms with the same asymptotic
# running time, except in unusual circumstances where the top-down
# approach does not actually recurse to examine all possible subproblems.
# The bottom-up approach often has much better constant factors, since
# it has lower overhead for procedure calls.
